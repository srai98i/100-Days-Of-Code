# 100-Days-Of-Code
Documenting my learnings through the #100DaysOfCode challenge

## Day 1
- Learned about Object Oriented Programming and Design Patterns. Watched a video explaining the four main principles of design patterns (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) and read an article about how these can be applied in Functional Programming. 
- Continued building the React Native Instagram Clone. Header and Stories components are complete, almost finished with building the Post component. Becoming more familiar with React Native components. Still find the debugging process a bit complicated.
