# 100-Days-Of-Code
Documenting my learnings through the #100DaysOfCode challenge

### Day 1
- Learned about Object Oriented Programming and Design Patterns. Watched a video explaining the four main principles of design patterns (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism) and read an article about how these can be applied in Functional Programming. 
- Continued building the React Native Instagram Clone. Header and Stories components are complete, almost finished with building the Post component. Becoming more familiar with React Native components. Still find the debugging process a bit complicated. 


### Day 2
- Made progress with the Positive Mind project. Used what I learnt from the React Native Instagram Clone Tutorial to help me with styling and functionality in this project.
- Almost finished building the Home Screen component of the Instagram clone. Only the BottomTab component functionality is needed to complete this screen. Becoming more familiar and comfortable with React Native and its quirks. 

### Day 3 
- More progress with the Positive Mind project. We have almost finished building one of the screens. The functionality of the button and a Navbar is needed to complete the Routine screen. 
- Solved a Codewars problem to practice my JavaScript skills. Broke down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks in order to find a solution. 

### Day 4
- Focused on Codewars to strengthen my Vanilla JS and problem solving skills. Practiced applying different array methods to find solutions. 

### Day 5 
- Made progress with the Instagram React Native Clone and finished building the HomeScreen component. Learnt about dynamic styling. 
- Attempted to build components without assistance and then compared my code to code from a tutorial. Seeing how someone more experienced would go about writing the same code I am writing is giving me an insight into how to write cleaner, more readable code. 

### Day 6
- Positive Mind (React Native): found an npm package to add a popup modal to our project so users can input tasks. Using props, we are working on passing individual functions to each display box which will handle submitting information to the correct data libs i.e morning tasks are stored in the morning data libs. 
- To Do (React): made some CSS adjustments and redeployed.
- Instagram React Clone (React Native): Started building another screen (AddNewPost).
